# AMon: A Domain-Specific Language and Framework for Adaptive Monitoring of Small Autonomous Vehicles

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are increasingly used in safety-critical scenarios. Ensuring their correct behavior at runtime becomes crucial, which is why systems' behavior needs to be monitored at runtime so that violations of requirements can be detected.

With the inception of edge devices that allow monitoring to be performed on the devices themselves, and the increasingly diverse environments that CPS operate in, flexible monitoring approaches are needed that consider the data that needs to be monitored and the analyses performed on that data. 
AMon is a flexible adaptive monitoring framework that supports the specification and validation of monitoring adaptation rules. AMon uses a [domain-specific language](/DSL/dsl.md ) and automatically generates code for direct deployment onto devices.
